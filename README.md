# **Important**

Open it in Firefox. The simulator doesn't work in Chrome or Chrome-derived
browsers because it uses SVG features that are standardized but not implemented
in Chrome. If I had more time, I would implement it differently. Sorry.

# Layout

There are two pages:

1. `index.html` which contains the simulator
2. `pages/explanation.html` which contains in depth explanation of finite
   automata. It was partially to demonstrate my technical writing ability.
