            Hi! I’m Aaron, and I want to share one of my favorite topics from my
            computer science undergrad: finite automata. I’ve wanted to write a
            simulator for them for a long time. I did (<a href="../index.html"
            >check it out</a>), but simulations are no fun if you don’t
            understand what’s happening. My goal is to teach you about a
            fascinating computer science topic without sounding like a computer
            scientist. You see, I spent a lot of time as a researcher in
            academia. The other academics taught me all about the maximally
            information-dense, serious, no pronouns or passive voice, formal
            style of writing. You know the one. The kind of textbook writing
            where expressing a single moment of joy is taken as implicit
            permission for an editor to set you aflame. I call it the academic
            no-style style. There will be none of that here. We’re allowed to
            have fun, so let’s have some fun learning about state machines toge-

            A nicer name for finite automata. Say hello to Nibbles. They are my
            assistant. They’ll be learning alongside us and causing mischief by
            asking tough questions at really annoying times. Don’t get too
            close. They bite :).
          </p>
          <h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
          <p>
            Understanding state machines has profoundly shaped my programming
            style. Noticing when a problem can be modelled as a finite
            automata—and encoding it as data types with functions between
            them—is a simple-yet-powerful problem solving tool. It can even
            yield a machine-checked proof of the validity of the implementation.
            And problems like that aren’t rare either. Take programming language
            syntax, for example: it’s modellable as a state machine, guiding you
            through patterns like
            <code>let -&gt; {name} -&gt; = -&gt; {expression} -&gt; ;</code>.
            Because programming and state machines share the same core
            principle—figuring out what to do next based on the current state of
            the program—I’ve found them to be a widely-applicable tool in many
            real programming domains.

          <p>By the end of this, we’re hoping to have ways to:</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li><em>Represent</em> that a given input is not valid</li>
            <li><em>Represent</em> that a given input is valid</li>
            <li>Make decisions about which inputs are valid or not</li>
          </ol>
          <div class="nibbles">
            <div class="nibbles-content">
              <img class="nibbles-img" src="../assets/doom.svg" />
              <span>Why did you write <em>represent</em> like that?</span>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Because <em>italics</em> are important. Keep it in mind. I promise
            I’ll come back to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            DFAs are powerful enough to satisfy these requirements but their
            limitations will become apparent. Namely, DFAs are like jellyfish:
            making decisions blindly with no memory of the past or future. So
            the next things on the wish list are ways to:
          </p>
          <ol start="4" type="1">
            <li>Remember the input</li>
            <li>Make decisions based on memory</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            To achieve these, we’ll invent a new, more powerful type of automata
            called PDAs with more memory than literally a single item. PDAs turn
            out to be powerful enough to model most things programmers care
            about. The limitations arise with their <em>representation</em>. Try
            as we might, we can’t write programs with pretty pictures.
          </p>
          <div class="nibbles">

              <span>That’s why ‘represent’ was important?</span>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Exactly! It’s also why the last wist list item becomes:</p>
          <ol start="6" type="1">
            <li>Translate the representation to a computational model</li>
          </ol>
          <h1 id="inputs">Inputs</h1>
          <p>
            Quick aside: inputs are the things we’re making decisions about.
            Technically they can be anything but computer scientists usually
            limit it to blocks of text. When I mention inputs, think words,
            strings, or
            <code>let varname = expression;</code>.

            DFAs are the simplest state machines, and will be what we build to
            start checking items off the wish list. They have some nice
            properties, like only requiring two ideas to be reach full

            This is how state machines represent wrong decisions. Isn’t it
            beautiful? It’s called a <em>rejecting state</em>. If
            decision-making ends with in a state like this, the input was
            rejected (or not accepted, invalid, malformed, etc.). Naturally,
            rejecting states have their counterpart, <em>accepting states</em>.
          </p>

            </svg>
          </div>
          <p>
            Moving between states like these are how state machines determine
            the outcome of decisions. Noticably absent still is the ability to
            make decisions. Enter transitions:

            The transition is the loopy bit. The beginning state is the
            non-arrow side, the destination state is whatever the arrow is
            pointing at, and the transition should be taken when the next bit of
            input is specified letter. It reads like “when in state <code>all
              'a'</code> and an ‘a’ is encountered in the input, transition to
            state <code>all 'a'</code>.”

            Ah. You’re right Nibbles. It’s allowed to do that because there are
            some implicit conventions in DFA representation. The one you’re
            running into is the trash rule. To keep the diagrams from having a
            bunch of transitions discarding irrelevant input, every state has an
            implicit transition that sends every input not covered by the
            transitions into an inescapable rejecting state. Something like
            this:

            There are a few more conventions but the most important one

            Because computer scientists have formal models that nail down all
            the ambiguity in state machine representations. We’ll do the same
            when we do our own translation to formal models. For now, the
            starting state will be pretty obvious. It will usually be the
            leftmost state.

          <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            DFAs are simple. That simplicity is a strength and a weakness. The
            strength is that DFAs are about the fastest computation a computer
            can do.
          </p>
          <div class="nibbles">
            <div class="nibbles-content">
              <img class="nibbles-img" src="../assets/doom.svg" />
              <span>I don’t believe you.</span>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Believe it Nibbles. Optimizing compilers can turn DFAs into just a
            few CPU instructions. (It does require the Earth, Moon, and stars to
            align for the optimizer heuristics to fully activate though.)
            Basically only straight-line number-crunching is faster. The
            weakness is that DFAs are relatively limited in power. I know the
            wish list has already spoiled it but try to think of the fatal flaw.
          </p>
          <p>…</p>

          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            DFAs have almost no memory. They can only compute things that
            require a
            <em>constant amount of memory</em>. The even zeroes DFA has three
            bits of memory: empty, even, and odd. The alternating ‘ab’ DFA has
            even less: expecting ‘a’ and expecting ‘b’. The corollary is that
            they can’t count; after all, counting would require them to remember
            an ever-increasing number of things. That limitation means things
            like programming language syntax are beyond the reach of DFAs. For
            example, they can’t enforce that each opening bracket “{” should
            have a corresponding closing bracket “}” because that requires the
            ability to keep track of how many opening brackets have occurred.

            If the fatal flaw of DFAs is limited memory, the obvious thing to do
            is give them some memory. Keeping with the theme of DFAs, we’ll do
            the simplest possible extensions until all the items of our wish
            list are checked off.

          <p>
            Surprisingly not! Lists and arrays are about the simplest in terms
            of structure (on account of not really having any) but have a couple
            capabilities that we can strip away to achieve maximum simplicity.
            Do you see what I’m getting at Nibbles?

            Yep 😈. Absolute maximum simplicity. Instead of lists or arrays, the
            new automata will use <em>stacks</em>. Stacks are basically the same
            as lists except only the first element is accessible. The only
            possible operations are accessing the first item, adding a new first
            item, and removing the old first item (<em>peek</em>, <em>push</em>,
            and
            <em>pop</em> respectively). Strictly speaking, it’s not even
            possible to replace an item.

          <p>
            I love it. It’s thematic! Automata only look at a single letter of
            input; why not let them access only a single letter of memory? This
            simple data structure and its operations are why the new
            constructions are called <em>pushdown automata</em>.
          </p>
          <h2 id="remembering-input">Remembering Input</h2>
          <p>
            The extension has been chosen; DFAs will gain an integrated stack to
            help them learn to count. Now let’s dive into the specifics of the
            integration. States will remain unchanged; they already represent
            individual bits of memory so there is no need to extend them with
            more. Transitions will not remain unchanged; just like how
            transitions were the mechanism by which DFAs made decisions, they
            will now additionally be the mechanism by which PDAs decide how to
            manipulate stacks. Transitions will now have three parts:
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>An input to consume. This part remains unchanged from DFAs.</li>
            <li>Zero or more items to push to the stack.</li>
            <li>Zero or more items to pop from the stack.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            We’ll write them like this:
            <code>--input, push operations, pop operations--&gt;</code>. Multple
            stack operations are written by concatenating them together
            e.g. pushing three separate zeroes and two ones is written
            <code>--input, 000, 11--&gt;</code>. It’s common for the push or pop
            operations to be empty, and leaving them blank is kind of ugly. To
            fix it, empty operations are written as ε.
          </p>
          <p>
            These stack operations are all it takes for the new automata to be
            able to count.

            <div class="nibbles-content">
              <img class="nibbles-img" src="../assets/doom.svg" />
              <span>That’s all it takes?</span>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Definitely. Consider the previous example of programming language
            brackets. PDAs can count how many opening brackets “{” occur by
            pushing one to the stack each time one is encountered and popping
            one for each “}”.
          </p>
          <div class="nibbles">
            <div class="nibbles-content">
              <img class="nibbles-img" src="../assets/doom.svg" />
              <span>What if there’s not the same amount?</span>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>We need another bit of our wish list for that. Hold on.</p>
          <h2 id="making-decisions">Making Decisions</h2>
          <p>
            PDAs can now remember input but they still can’t use that
            information. We need to allow PDAs to make decisions based on the
            status of the stack in order for the newfound memory to be
            meaningful. We let PDAs accept or reject an input based on two new
            criteria:
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              Popping from an empty stack is an instant reject. This is similar
              to the trash rule in a DFA.
            </li>
            <li>The stack must be empty for an input to be accepted.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            These rejection criteria give them a notion of <em>equality</em>. So
            to answer your question Nibbles, if there are too few “}”, the stack
            won’t be empty and the input will be rejected. If there are too many
            “}”, the PDA will try to pop from an empty stack and be rejected.
          </p>
          <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
          <p>
            Let’s try to create the automaton we’ve been using as an example.
            I’ll give some pointers as we go.
          </p>
          <p>
            The requirements have already been sketched out but could be more
            explicit. We want to build an automaton that accepts strings of “{”s
            followed by an equal number of “}”s. The empty string does fit that
            definition but let’s make the string require at least one “{”. Ready
            Nibbles?

          </div>
          <p>
            I’ve already given a couple hints in the previous examples. The
            biggest is that there will be at least two transitions, one for
            pushing “{”s and one for popping “}”s. Think about what input each
            transition should consume.
          </p>

            Well done! There are some interesting extensions to this example.
            One is making it accept the empty string. Another is making it
            accept some “{”s followed by twice as many “}”s. Try to work through
            it on your own, Nibbles. I’ve left a completed PDA for this problem

            We’re on the home stretch. Unfortunately, this is the stretch where
            I am the least help. I want to provide some familiarity with the
            formalism of state machines so that outside reading won’t look like
            hieroglyphics. I can’t, however, cover the entire foundation of
            computer science conventions. I assume familiarity with mathematical
            functions and the first 15 minutes of set theoretic conventions. No
            one is more disappointed about it than me. Sorry :’(.

          <p>
            We’ve been especially vague about what input is. The definition up

            is a <em>string</em> consisting of zero or more characters from a

            Correct. There is a similar set
            <math

              display="inline"

            is how we denote the an empty stack. This has the corollary that
            every PDA will push a

            somewhere early on and check for <math

            may appear in the stack. Finally, the set of all inputs accepted by
            the PDA is called the <em>language</em>

            States are modelled as a finite set

          <p>
            Not gonna lie, the formalism for transitions is straight up awful.
            Transitions are modelled by the <em>transition function</em>

            are modelled by a function that takes a state, an input character,
            and a stack character and returns the corresponding destination
            state and stack operation.
